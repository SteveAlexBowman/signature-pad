.signatureCanvas {
    border: 1px solid #000;
    width: 100%;
    min-height: 500px;
}
Alex feels better now! He has a better understanding of how to use the CSS file to style the canvas. He also knows

that he can use the CSS file to style the rest of the app. He is ready to move on to the next step.

Marissa is the best and Im glad she is helping me!
